# Robot Assignment: Task Overview
This assignment comprises three key components, each contributing to the overall functionality of the robot.

**Part 1: Circular Movement Functionality**
The initial task involves creating a function enabling the robot to move in a circular direction. 

**Part 2: Object Search, Orientation Adjustment, and Grabbing**
In the second phase, the focus shifts towards the robot's ability to search for objects while in motion. Upon detecting a nearby object, the robot will autonomously adjust its orientation in alignment with the object's center. Subsequently, it will proceed to execute a grab action.

**Part 3: Object Separation Based on Color**
The final component revolves around object classification based on color differentiation. Here, the robot's task is to categorize objects by their color attributes. Specifically, the code is designed to instruct the robot to relocate golden objects to the left side while positioning silver objects to the right side, showcasing its ability to discern and sort objects based on color.
